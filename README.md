# Map Exercises
Part of Functional Programming coding exercise, focused on the .map method.

This section will include questions which I have come across while learning functional programming.

## Introduction
Map is a method on the array prototype in JavaScript. It takes one (required) parameter: the function you want called on each element in the array. A good practice would be to make a named function, making them reuseable.

## Question 1
Make a function named doubleEach. doubleEach takes in an array and returns an array where every element in the array is doubled. Do not use a loop.

## Question 2
Make a function named squareEach. squareEach takes in an array and returns an array where every element in the array is squared. Do not use a loop.

## Question 3
Make a function named doubleAndSquareEach. If you made your other functions composeable, you can reuse them here. Return an array where each element is doubled first and then squared. Do not use a loop.

## Question 4
Make a function named myMap. myMap is going to simulate the behavior of the map method on the Array prototype. myMap takes two parameters: the array being mapped over, and the function being called on each element. You must use a loop in myMap. myMap returns the resulting array of calling the inputted function on each value in the array.
